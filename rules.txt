# Rules for Code Modification

1. Do NOT change the core logic of the application.
   - Logic includes data manipulation, conditional flows, algorithms, or any function that affects business behavior.
   - Refactoring for readability is allowed only if the behavior/output remains identical.

2. API endpoints must remain the same.
   - Do not rename, remove, or add API routes.
   - The request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and expected request/response formats must not be modified.

3. Only non-functional improvements are allowed unless explicitly requested.
   - Examples: code formatting, adding comments, renaming variables (without changing meaning), UI styling tweaks.

4. Any change outside of these rules must be approved explicitly before proceeding.

# Reminder:
These rules help maintain the stability and integration of the existing application with backend and frontend systems.
