BUILD FOR GEHU

## Curved Path Feature

The application supports creating curved or multi-segment roads using the following process:

1. In the Admin Map Editor:
   - Click on the map to start a new road
   - Continue clicking to add intermediate points to create curves or angles
   - Right-click or use the "Complete Path" button to finish the current road
   - The road will follow all the points you've created in sequence

2. Technical Details:
   - Curved paths are stored as a series of points in the `points` field of the TrafficData model
   - The frontend renders these points as connected line segments
   - Vehicles follow the exact path through all intermediate points
   - Path finding algorithms consider all segments of the curved roads

This feature allows for more realistic road networks that follow the contours of the map.
